# ShellSetup
ZSHShell with Vim Plugins

ZSH Shell Setup:

Setting up ZSH can be done in multiple ways. I have created a setup for me that integrates both autocompletion and
auto suggestions. As you can see below these are two key features in ZSH that work really well.
Also note with the configuration file .zshrc I have added some extra features. When you double tab in ZSH you can
interact with the shell and select the command option from the provided list instead of having to scroll through each
as they appear in Bash.
Also incorporated are customized powerlevel10k shell themes for PopOS, Fedora, Rocky Linux. 
Here are two screenshots demonstrating the key features and the Powerlevel10k theme.
